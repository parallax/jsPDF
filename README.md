**A library to generate PDFs in JavaScript.**

You can [catch me on twitter](http://twitter.com/MrRio): [@MrRio](http://twitter.com/MrRio) or head over to [my company's website](http://parall.ax) for consultancy.

## [Live Demo](http://raw.githack.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/) | [Documentation](http://raw.githack.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/docs/)

## Creating your first document

The easiest way to get started is to drop the CDN hosted library into your page:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/1.5.3/jspdf.debug.js" integrity="sha384-NaWTHo/8YCBYJ59830LTz/P4aQZK1sS0SneOgAvhsIl3zBu8r9RevNg5lHCHAuQ/" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Integrity-hash generated by https://www.srihash.org/

or can always get latest version via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/#/)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jspdf@latest/dist/jspdf.min.js"></script>
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add jspdf
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm install jspdf --save
```

Then you're ready to start making your document:

```javascript
// Default export is a4 paper, portrait, using millimeters for units
var doc = new jsPDF()

doc.text('Hello world!', 10, 10)
doc.save('a4.pdf')
```

If you want to change the paper size, orientation, or units, you can do:

```javascript
// Landscape export, 2×4 inches
var doc = new jsPDF({
  orientation: 'landscape',
  unit: 'in',
  format: [4, 2]
})

doc.text('Hello world!', 1, 1)
doc.save('two-by-four.pdf')

```

## Use of UTF-8 / TTF:

The 14 standard fonts in PDF are limited to the ASCII-codepage. If you want to use UTF-8 you have to to integrate a custom font, which provides the needed glyphs. jsPDF supports .ttf-files. So if you want to have for example chinese text in your pdf, your font has to have the necessary chinese glyphs. So check if your font supports the wanted glyphs or else it will show a blank space instead of the text.

To add the font to jsPDF use our fontconverter in [/fontconverter/fontconverter.html](https://rawgit.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/fontconverter/fontconverter.html) . The fontconverter will create a js-file with the content of the provided ttf-file as base64 encoded string and additional code for jsPDF. You just have to add this generated js-File to your project. You are then ready to go to use setFont-method in your code and write your UTF-8 encoded text.

## Angular/Webpack/React/etc. Configuration:

If you are using Webpack (including managed cli tools like angular-cli or create-react-app) you can import like this:

```
import * as jsPDF from 'jspdf'
```

In some frameworks you have to import jsPDF like this:

```
import jsPDF from 'jspdf';
```

You can add jsPDF to your meteor-project as follows:

```
meteor add jspdf:core
```

## Advanced Functionality

Since the merge with the [yWorks fork](https://github.com/yWorks/jsPDF) there are a lot of new features. However, some
of them are API breaking, which is why there is an API-switch between two API modes:

 * In "compat" API mode, jsPDF has the same API as MrRio's original version, which means full compatibility with plugins.
  However, some advanced features like transformation matrices and patterns won't work. This is the default mode.
 * In "advanced" API mode, jsPDF has the API you're used from the yWorks-fork version. This means the availability of
  all advanced features like patterns, FormObjects and transformation matrices.

You can switch between the two modes by calling
```javascript
doc.advancedAPI(doc => {
  // your code
})
// or
doc.compatAPI(doc => {
  // your code
})
```
JsPDF will automatically switch back to the original API mode after the callback has run.

## Support

Please check if your question is already handled at Stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jspdf>.
Feel free to ask a question there with the tag `jspdf`.

Feature requests, bug reports etc. are very welcome as issues. Note that bug reports should follow these guidelines:

* A bug should be reported as an [mcve](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
* Make sure code is properly indented and [formatted](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code) (Use ``` around code blocks)
* Provide a runnable example.
* Try to make sure and show in your issue that the issue is actually related to jspdf and not your framework of choice your setup.

## Contributing

Build the library with `npm run build`. This will fetch all dependencies and then compile the `dist` files. To see the examples locally you can start a web server with `npm start` and go to `localhost:8000`.

Alternatively, you can build jsPDF using these commands in a readily configured online workspace:
